# You are building a small command-line application to calculate hotel availability for a city.
# Your application reads in two data files, and outputs it's answer in STDOUT.
# Your application will read-in:
# -> a list of hotels along with how many rooms each contains (in no particular order)
# -> a list of bookings that have been made (in no particular order)

# Your application will then print the list of all hotels which have availability for check-in check-out date range,
# if any. Do not worry about whether a specific room is available in a hotel for the entire booking period without
# switching rooms: availability is defined as the hotel having at least one (1) available room for each night of the
# target stay, regardless of whether it is the same room from day to day.
